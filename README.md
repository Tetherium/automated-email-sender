# Python Safe Bulk Mailer 📬

A robust and simple Python-based email automation tool designed to send personalized emails from an Excel database. This script includes built-in **anti-spam mechanisms** like randomized delays and cooldown periods to protect your sender reputation.

## 🚀 Features
* **Anti-Spam Logic:** Randomized wait times (45-90s) between emails.
* **Cooldown Periods:** Automatically pauses for 5 minutes after every 10 emails.
* **Excel Integration:** Reads recipient emails and custom messages directly from `.xlsx` files.
